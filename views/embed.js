## Set up and override python functions for embedding
# Embedded pages are our own pages used as iframes within the viewer, and have e.g. toolbars etc absent.
# They also have pinch-zooming turned off, as this zooms the entire page, not just the iframe
# We may also wish to "sandbox" links within embedded pages e.g. for museum displays. 
# The degree of sandboxing is specified by the 'embed' parameter as follows:
#1 no sandboxing: all links open as normal. Links that are internal (i.e. use the URL helper) 
#  should pass on the embed status (this also avoids embedding the tree viewer itself) (normal display)
#  We would probably like to stop URLs that open in a new tab (e.g. within an A(... _target="_blank") helper
#  from also adding embed, but this is difficult to do, so these should be hardcoded urls instead
#2 minor "sandbox": all links open in a new tab (the "embed" need not be passed on to these links)
#3 can only follow relative links without _target set (and cannot e.g. right click): embed status should be passed on (normal museum display)
#4 cannot follow links at all (and cannot e.g. right click)
